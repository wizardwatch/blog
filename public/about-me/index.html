<p>My name is Wyatt, though on the web I am usually addressed as wizardwatch. I am a highschool student with an interest in computer science, especially as it relates to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>.</p>
<h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>
<h2 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h2>
<p>I originally became interested in computer science in the fifth grade. I had just been given a windows laptop and managed to install malware on it months after first learning how to open a web browser. When I realized how little I knew about how the computer worked I had an epiphany, that I simply must learn everything there is to know about computers. My naive self would have never guessed how much there is to know, yet I have never given up on my goal. I hope to one day be able to look back and say somewhat conclusively, I know about computers.</p>
<h3 id="nixos">NixOS</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, a GNU/Linux distribution focused on being reproducible, declarative, and by the previous goals, reliable. While I never intend to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/729334-when-i-was-one-i-had-just-begun-when-i">grow up</a>, when I am forced to start adulting I hope to work with it professionally.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I remember the day I joined band, it was after all one day late. My application wasn&rsquo;t signed until the day after the final &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t have it in now you are out of luck&rdquo; date. Fortunately, the importance of that date was greatly overstated, I managed to join band in the sixth grade. I play the Alto and Baritone Saxophone in my school band and am learning the piano, though my piano skills have a long way to go.</p>
