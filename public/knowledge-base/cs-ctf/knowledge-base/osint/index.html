<p>The goal of image coordinate identification questions is to
find where an image was taken and/or other details
surrounding the circumstances of the image.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-image-search">Reverse Image search</h2>
<p>Reverse image searching is one of the most
bang-for-your-buck techniques in image coordinate
identification. It also offers a launching point to find
search terms that describe your image.</p>
<p>Here are some good reverse image search engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://images.google.com/">Google</a>&mdash;especially for
images taken from Google maps</li>
<li><a href="https://yandex.com/images/">Yandex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tineye.com/">TinEye</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flags">Flags</h2>
<p>Self-explanatory&mdash;images where you see a flag were probably
taken in the place that uses said flag!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.flags.net/fullindex.htm">World Flag Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://flagpedia.net/index">Flagpedia.net</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories#Current_state_flags">Flags of the U.S. states and
territories</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_counties_of_the_United_States">Flags of counties of the United
States</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_cities_of_the_United_States">Flags of cities of the United
States</a></li>
<li><a href="https://europeanheraldry.org/">European Heraldry</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_Europe">Flags of
Europe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://flagid.org/">Identify a Flag</a>
If you can&rsquo;t find the flag in those databases, try to create
a mockup of it in an image editor and reverse image search
that image.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<p>Observing what language(s) are used on signs in the area can
cut out swaths of potential locations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> can
automatically detect languages</li>
<li><a href="https://theweek.com/articles/617776/how-identify-language-glance">Identify Languages at a
Glance</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signs-and-streets">Signs and Streets</h2>
<p>Streets and intersections can quickly identify a location.
Interstate, highway, or route signs can give a general path
where an image may have been taken.</p>
<p>Advertisements for regional products can reduce possible
locations as well.</p>
<h2 id="cars">Cars</h2>
<p>What side of the road do cars drive on?
What color/shape are the plates? Are they on the front or
back of cars?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/">License Plates of the
World</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="landmarks">Landmarks</h2>
<p>Usually, these questions will have one or more large
landmarks. At this point, you should know the general
location the image was taken&mdash;it&rsquo;s a matter of finding
those landmarks in that area.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s very famous, a landmark might not be much of a
help. From a distance, mountains look like mountains.</p>
<h2 id="people">People</h2>
<p>Examine common patterns between people in the image. The
most prominent features of a person in a blurry photo are
race and weight. Compare the make-up of a crowd to known
statistics of possible locations.</p>
<p>This is sometimes an unrealiable metric&mdash;obesity rates and
racial makeup can be hyperlocalized.</p>
<h2 id="minutiae-questions">Minutiae Questions</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still stuck, these are some miscellaneous
questions you can ask yourself to help narrow down a
location:
What style fire hydrants are used?
How are the road signs styled?</p>
